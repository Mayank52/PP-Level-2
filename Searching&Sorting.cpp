such that all elements in left half <= right half
We check that the leftMax of arr1 <= rightMin of arr2
and leftMax of arr2 <= rightMin of arr1

Also, we take

Then even if we take the complete second array, we still need atleast 1 element

// 786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction
/*
Approach: Binary Search, O(nlogn)
We do a binary search on the value of fraction
lo = 0, hi = 1
Since they are all prime fractions, so they are in range 0 to 1

Now if we consider a group of fractions, and each fraction in this group is <= mid
then, if the number of fractions in the group = k
Then there are only those k fractions that are <= mid
This means the max of that group is the kth smallest prime fraction
If our count > k, then we need to increase the allowed value, so check in right side
Else left side

So, at each step of binary search, find the number of fractions < mid, and the
max among those fractions and accordingly move lo and hi.
We can find the count and max fraction in O(n+m) using the Staircase method
If we put the fractions in a matrix sorted rowwise and column wise, then we start from 0th row
and start a pointer j from its end, and move back in that row until fraction > k
This way we will eliminate all > k fractions in current row, and we have j number of fractions
<= k. 
Then for next row we will start checking from same column j, as everything after j is 
definately > k, as matrix is sorted row and column wise, doing this we will finish 
current row and move to next row until no columns are left and max time will be O(n + m).
And the traversal we do in this method looks like a reverse staircase.

Eg:
[1,2,3,5,7,13]

1/7 1/5 1/3 1/2
2/7 2/5 2/3
3/7 3/5
5/7

Now lo = 0, hi = 1
mid = (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5

2/7 2/5

// 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
/*
Wrong Approach: 
If we try exactly the above approach it wont work as the matrix can have duplicates
Eg: [[1,2],[1,3]], K = 1
Here the answer should be 1, but when it counts element <= 1, then it will get count = 2
so, it will move on to next answer and we will never get count = 1 for the first two 1s
So, we have to change the above approach a little

Approach: O(nlog(max - min))
Use Binary Search to find the answer
The range is min value in matrix to max value in matrix
If the count of elements <= mid is less than k, then we need to increase mid,
So, we reject left side
Else reject right side
At the end when lo==hi, lo is the answer

In this way of binary search, we find the element which is equal to the answer
And if answer is not present we find the just greater element
At the end lo, hi, mid are all equal and we return lo as the answer
So, we can only get the answer count == k, when this happens we 3 cases:
1. ans = mid, in this case, we just keep searching in range lo to mid.
2. ans < mid, in this case also, we just keep searching in range lo to mid.
3. ans > mid, this is not possible, because if ans > mid, then count of elements <= mid would be less than k

So, we eventually mid will be equal to the ans.
Because the ans is always in lo to mid range, as we only move lo when the count < k (which is condition for 
answer cannot be in lo to mid range). So, since we decrease hi, whenever we find a possible answer, so, at
the end lo is equal to answer.

So, when the search stops, mid will definetely be present in the matrix, as we are finding the lower bound using
binary search. So, there cannot be any number present in the matrix that will be smaller than lo.

Approach: O(n)
We use the same approach as with non duplicates
But in case of duplicates 
if arr[mid] == arr[hi], then we do hi--
We can have following cases:
[2,2,2,0,1]
[2,2,2,0,2]
[2,2,2,2,2]

So, in worst case we will need a linear search to find the min element
Because there is no way to find which side to go if arr[mid] == arr[hi]
So, we just reduce the upper limit by 1, and check again

// 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
/*
Approach 1: O(logn)
1. Find the pivot index of array
2. If target > last element of array, then it lies in left of pivot
   Else it lies in right of pivot
3. Use binary on that side, as that side will be completely sorted

Approach 2: O(logn)
We can also do it without finding the pivot first
We take lo = 0, hi = n-1
Then we take the mid

We have following cases:
1. If both the target and mid, lie on same side of pivot, then we have 2 cases:
    1. If nums[mid] < target: check on right side of mid
    2. Else check on left of mid
2. Else, we check which side of pivot target lies on:
    If target > nums[n-1] then we check on left of mid.
    Else we check on right of mid

Because if they both lie on same side of pivot i.e. left or right side of pivot,
then they will both lie in sorted order, as left and right side of pivot are sorted
So, in this case we can find which side to reject by comparing target and mid value

But if they lie in different sides, then to compare mid and target directly, we need
to know which side they both lie on. As if mid is in left side, then it will be greater then 
all elements on right of pivot. In this case if target < nums[mid], then we need to check 
in right. So, in case of different sides, we just check which side the target lies on,
And accordingly change the search space instead of comparing target and mid

// 136. Single Number
/*
Approach 1: O(n)
Using XOR

Approach 2: O(nlogn), Binary Search
If in this array every number duplicate number was present adjacent to each other
Eg: 2 2 3 3 4 4 7 7 5 5 1 6 6

Here every element that is present twice is adjacent.
In this case we can use binary search.

Array: 2 2 3 3 4 4 7 7 5 5 1  6  6
Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
If we look at the array now, the single element divides the array into 2 parts:
1. Left part: Here if an element is present at odd index, then its duplicate is at its previous index.
                And if it is at even index, then duplicate is at next index
2. Right part: Here it is reverse of left side
        Here if the element is present at odd index, then duplicate is at its next index
        And for even index, duplicate is at previous index

So, we start our binary search with
lo = 0, hi = n - 1
mid = (lo + hi) / 2

Now for the mid element we check the above condition to check which region we are in
If mid is in left side, then we update lo = mid + 1, to go to right side, and 
if mid is right side, then update hi = mid - 1, to go to left side
This way, when lo==hi, then mid element is the single element

Also, this same approach works if every element is duplicate, and one is 3 times
Because it is the same case, we can consider 2 out of 3 copies of that element as different elements

Using this approach when duplicates are not adjacent is O(nlogn) as will have to sort to bring them 
adjacent first or bring them adjacent some other way.
Then binary search is just O(logn)

However this approach is O(logn) so it will be better than XOR sum if elements are adjacent from starting.

Approach 1: O(n^2)
Keep an array of intervals.

This takes O(n) for each interval.

Approach 2: O(nlogn)
If we keep BST, then we can check if it overlaps in O(logn) and add in O(logn)
So, just use a ordered_set, and using binary search to find the <= interval for 
the current interval and check if the current interval overlaps with the next or previous 
interval.
For eg: 
the lower bound gives the equal or just greater element
So, like we searched [20,30], then we got [25,35]

Wrong Approach: O(nlogn)
We can keep 2 ordered sets: intervals, all overlaps that are double booked
Now for current interval, check if it overlaps with any present overlaps
If it is present, then that overlap is triple booked, so return false.
Else find if it overlaps with any interval and add the overlap in the overlaps set
as that overlap is now double booked. 
But the current interval can overlap with more that just the previous and next interval.
So, if we only check with those two, then overlap set wont have all the overlaps.
Eg:
Intervals: 42 61, 44 55, 58 73, 70 82, 60 70

i = 1
intervals: 42 61
overlaps:

i = 2
intervals: 42 61, 44 55
overlaps: 44 55

i = 3
intervals: 42 61, 44 55, 58 73
overlaps: 44 55

So, here we got 58, 73. The overlaps will be
[58 61] with [42 61]
But we will not check that because we are only checking with prev and next intervals
So, the logn approach does not work.
As the current interval can overlap with any interval before it
Because their end time may be after the current interval 
So, [58 61] wont be added to the overlaps.
So, if that interval gets booked again then it will return true.

i = 4
intervals: 42 61, 44 55, 58 73, 70 82
overlaps: 44 55, 70 73

i = 5
intervals: 42 61, 44 55, 58 73, 60, 70, 70 82
overlaps: 44 55, 60, 70, 70 73

As the [58 61] was not added so it got triple booked now.

Correct Approach: O(n^2)
For bookings > 1, it becomes same as Minimum Number of Platforms/Stations Required
We are basically saying that you cannot have more than 2 stations at the same time.
Here instead of maintaing 2 sorted arrays: start and end times
Just maintain an ordered map in which we will do +1 for start times and -1 for end times

So, for each booking just add the current interval
Then check if there are more than 2 bookings required at a time, then return false
Else return true

// Sort an array of strings without converting them to integers(912. Sort an Array)
/*
Approach : O(nlogn)
We have to sort an array, where numbers are given as strings.
And we have sort this array without converting these strings to int.

In sorting strings they are sorted lexicographically.
So, they are compared at index 0, if they are equal then their index 1 is compared as so on.
So, to sort them in increasing order, we should first check if they have equal size, 
then directly use s1 < s2.
Otherwise if they have different sizes, then sort on basis of size
This approach works for +ve numbers.

For negative numbers, if both are negative then just sort them in opposite order
And if one of them is negative, then put the negative one first.

In Code, in lambda function we return s1 < s2 to sort in increasing order
So, basically if the function returns true, then the order of elements remains the same
So, if we want to place the -ve string first, and +ve string second then we need to check
if s1[0] == '-', this means the first string is -ve, so it is already in right order
So, in this case return true,
And if s2[0] == '-', then we want to change the order as we want s2 first, so return false.

Below question is to just test this approach, as this specific question is not given anywhere
to submit.
